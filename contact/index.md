My office is located in Amsterdam (the Netherlands). I especially love to work for graphical designers and advertising agencies. I do not out-source my work, nor do I hire interns. If you hire me, I will be the one that does the job.

Have you got a question, or do you need a quote or a fully specified offer? Feel free to send me an email at [joost@usecue.com](mailto:joost@usecue.com) or call at +31 (0)6 185 189 28. I can also be found on [Github](https://github.com/jhvanderschee), [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/users/2397550/joosts) and [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joost-van-der-schee-4b26682/).
