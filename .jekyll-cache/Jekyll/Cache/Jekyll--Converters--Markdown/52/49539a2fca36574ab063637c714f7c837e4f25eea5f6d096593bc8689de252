I"<p>My name is Joost van der Schee and I am a web developer based in Amsterdam. I have studied Industrial Design Engineering at the Technical University in Delft and founded ‘Usecue’ in 2007. My first priority is my family, but my work is absolutely number two. I love what I do, which is building beautiful websites and web applications.</p>

<p>All websites I build are well-coded and have good SEO. This is reflected by their excellent <a href="/blog/google-lighthouse-score/">Google score</a>, an objective quality measurement of a website. Quality is very important to me. I strongly believe that each job worth doing is worth doing well.</p>

<p>I am a big fan of Jekyll (a website generator). To help fellow Jekyll-enthusiasts, I have launched <a href="http://jekyllcodex.org">jekyllcodex.org</a> and I answer Jekyll-related questions on <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/2397550/joosts">Stack Overflow</a>. <a href="https://cloudcannon.com/">CloudCannon</a> (an online CMS for Jekyll) mentioned me as a Jekyll expert on their ‘<a href="https://cloudcannon.com/experts/">experts page</a>’. I was also one of the speakers on <a href="https://jekyllconf.com/">JekyllConf 2019</a>.</p>

<p>Apart from Jekyll/CloudCannon websites I also develop WordPress, Issuu, MailChimp, Shopify and custom web solutions. My latest projects include <a href="https://www.invoicelion.org/">open source invoicing software</a>, called ‘Invoice Lion’, a progressive web app (PWA) for my company and a <a href="https://withoutcoding.com">platform for producing online magazines</a>, called ‘Without Coding’.</p>
