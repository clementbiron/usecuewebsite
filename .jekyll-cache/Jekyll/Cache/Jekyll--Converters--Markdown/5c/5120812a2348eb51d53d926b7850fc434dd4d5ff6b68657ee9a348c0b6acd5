I"ª<p>For Maike I built a cute small website, which I also designed based on her logo. The site has an almost <a href="/blog/how-to-get-a100-google-lighthouse-score/">perfect Google Lighthouse score</a> and can be managed in the CloudCannon CMS by Maike herself. The pages weigh only 125kb, require less than 10 requests and have a speed index of under 2 seconds. I am quite proud of this website and the best is: so is she.</p>
