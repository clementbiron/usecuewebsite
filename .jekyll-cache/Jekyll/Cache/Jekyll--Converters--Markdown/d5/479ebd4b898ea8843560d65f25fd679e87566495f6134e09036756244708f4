I"Í<p>I have the strong conviction that I will not build the same interface twice. Therefore I always chose to develop for the web ONLY (and not for native). I have seen â€˜native applicationsâ€™ as an old-fashioned concept from the start. Installing software is a thing of the past, in my opinion.</p>

<p>So if you know Turbolinks, you understand why I got enthousiastic. If you donâ€™t, let me explainâ€¦ If you build a native application with a webview or a PWA for Safari/iOS you are required to make it a single page application (often referred to as an SPA). Turbolinks converts a normal website into an SPA. The concept is simple: Turbolinks swaps all page loads for Ajax calls. The nice thing is that it works in any HTML document. I have written a simple demo, showcasing how it works. You can find it here: <a href="http://apps.usecue.com/turbolinks5">http://apps.usecue.com/turbolinks5</a>.</p>

<p>Simply put: Turbolinks enables you to re-use all screens from your website in your native app (webview) or PWA on iOS. One drawback that limits this approach to PWAâ€™s only: Apple might not approve webview-only native apps. They will probably reject it due to â€˜a lack of contentâ€™. I found this out the hard way.</p>
