I"ë	<p>What is the â€˜Google scoreâ€™ in your portfolio exactly, you ask? The short answer is: it is a measurement from Google, that indicates the quality of a website.</p>

<p>To generate this score Google renders the website in Chrome. While doing so, Google analyzes the code and performance of your website in a series of audits. These audits are seperated into four categories: Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices and SEO. Each category scores between 0 and 100, where 100 is the best and 0 is the worst score. If you want to check the score or the audits yourself, you can do so at the <a href="https://web.dev">web.dev website</a>.</p>

<p>Note that on my portfolio I refer to the average of these four categories as the â€˜Google scoreâ€™ for simplicity reasons. These numbers are typically very high, because I know <a href="/blog/how-to-get-a-100-google-lighthouse-score/">how to get a 100% Google Lighthouse score</a>.</p>

<h2 id="performance">Performance</h2>

<p>Performance is the speed at which a website loads. Lighthouse returns a Performance score between 0 and 100. 0 is the lowest possible score. 100 is the best possible score which represents the 98th percentile, a top-performing site. A score of 50 represents the 75th percentile. An important performance metric is the <a href="/blog/speed-index-explained/">Speed index</a>.</p>

<h2 id="accessibility">Accessibility</h2>

<p>Accessibility is the design of products, devices, services, or environments for people with disabilities. The Accessibility score is a weighted average of all the accessibility audits. See the <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/v3/scoring">scoring details</a> for a full list of how each audit is weighted. The heavier-weighted audits have a bigger impact on your score.</p>

<h2 id="best-practices">Best Practices</h2>

<p>Best Practices is a list of audits that check common mistakes in web development. Lighthouse returns a Best Practices score between 0 and 100. 0 is the worst possible score, and 100 is the best. The Best Practices audits are equally weighted.</p>

<h2 id="seo">SEO</h2>

<p>Search engine optimization (SEO) is the process of increasing the quality and quantity of website traffic by increasing the visibility of a website or a web page to users of a web search engine. Lighthouse returns a SEO score between 0 and 100. 0 is the worst possible score, and 100 is the best. A website with a high SEO score will end up higher in the search results than a website with a low SEO score.</p>
