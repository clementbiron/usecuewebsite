I"5<p>SSL or Secure Socket Layer is better known as the S in HTTPS. It stands for an encrypted connection between the website and the visitor. So why should you upgrade? Here are the three main reasons:</p>

<h2 id="1-security-and-privacy">1. Security and privacy</h2>

<p>The most important reason is that is safer for you and for your visitors to use an SSL website.</p>

<h2 id="2-higher-google-ranking">2. Higher Google ranking</h2>

<p>Google will rank websites with SSL higher then website without SSL. This is Googles way of promoting a safer internet.</p>

<h2 id="3-authenticity">3. Authenticity</h2>

<p>Give clients and extra reason to trust your company by having that green icon and the word ‘Secure’ before your domain name. In the near future <a href="https://blog.chromium.org/2017/04/next-steps-toward-more-connection.html">Google will shame you</a>, by showing ‘Not Secure’ on non-SSL pages in Chrome.</p>

<h2 id="so-you-want-ssl">So… you want SSL?</h2>
