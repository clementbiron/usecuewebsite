I"Y	<p>Although I can almost build a website in my sleep (or in <a href="/blog/speaking-at-jekyllconf2019/">20 minutes</a>), I am not talking about REM sleep or Rapid Eye Movement, but about ‘root em’.</p>

<p>I used to build websites in pixels, but I have chosen to abandon pixels and to completely swap to <em>em</em>, and the be more specific <em>root em</em>. Forty percent of all pages use <em>root em</em> in some way, according to the <a href="https://almanac.httparchive.org/en/2019/css#units">HTTP Archive Almanac</a>, so you are probably familiar with the abbreviation ‘rem’.</p>

<p>The ‘em’ is a fascinating unit/measurement. It originates from the height of the metal body of a letter in a letterpress and its name comes from its relation to the width of the captial letter ‘M’. In this digital era this relation has blurred. According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Em_(typography)">Wikipedia</a>, an average font might have a cap height of 70% of the <em>em</em>, and an x-height of 48% of the <em>em</em>. ‘Root’ means that the size of the <em>em</em> is related to the font-size of the root element, which it the HTML element of your web page.</p>

<p>Here is how it works: If you set your font-size to 20px on the HTML element, 1 <em>root em</em> will equal 20 pixels. So, <em>root em</em> equals the root font-size. A pixel becomes 1/20th by 1/20th <em>root em</em> big. A larger font could have a font-size of 2 <em>root em</em> (40px) and your body text could be 0.8 <em>root em</em> (16px). And a nice extra: even media queries can be defined in <em>root em</em>.</p>

<p>So if <em>root em</em> is nothing more than a multiplier, why should you use it? Well… only for one reason actually: it makes simulating browser zoom much easier. A common media query that takes advantage of this would be: if the screen is narrower than 600 pixels (30rem), bump the font-size of the HTML element up to 22 pixels. This media query will show your website at 110% scale, with just a single line of CSS.</p>

<p>Sounds great, but is it worth the extra effort? I think it is. I got used to this new approach quickly and it soon felt as easy as using pixels. Situation in which I find this approach extremely helpful are: handling very large and very small screen sizes and Google or some designer complaining about the chosen website width or font-size.</p>
