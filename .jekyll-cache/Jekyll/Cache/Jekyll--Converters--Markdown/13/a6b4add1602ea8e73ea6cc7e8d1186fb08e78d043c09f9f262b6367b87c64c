I"–<p>Today marks an important milestone. Over the last 18 months the people from <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com">Smashing Magazine</a> have been working on a complete overhaul of there website, both technical and visual. And they are <a href="https://next.smashingmagazine.com/2017/03/a-little-surprise-is-waiting-for-you-here--meet-the-next-smashing-magazine/">almost ready to launch</a>.</p>

<h2 id="whats-different-well-everything">Whatâ€™s different? Well, everything.</h2>

<p>The website wonâ€™t be running on WordPress anymore; in fact, it wonâ€™t have a back end at all. They are moving to a JAMstack: articles published directly to Netlify CDNs, with a custom shop based on an open-sourced headless E-Commerce (GoCommerce) and a job board thatâ€™s all just static HTML; content editing with Netlifyâ€™s new open-source, Git-Based CMS, real-time search powered by Algolia, full HTTP/2 support, and the whole website running as a progressive web app with a service worker in the background (thanks to the awesome Service Worker Toolbox library). Booo-yah!</p>

<p>They now use static HTML with advanced JavaScript APIs, running as a progressive web app with a service worker in the background. This results in blazingly fast performance â€” all served from a CDN near you.</p>

<h2 id="how-does-that-work">How does that work?</h2>

<p>Quite simple, actually. Content is stored in Markdown files. HTML is pre-baked using the static site generator, combined with a modern asset pipeline built with Gulp and webpack. They have spiced it all up with a handful of fancy APIs, including ones by Stripe for payments, Algolia for search, Cloudinary for responsive images, and Netlifyâ€™s open-source APIs GoCommerce (a headless e-commerce API), GoTrue for authentication, and GoTell for our more than 150,000 comments.</p>

<h2 id="impressive">Impressive!</h2>

<p>Sureâ€¦ but Smashing Magazine is a big player. They can pull off everything. But what if I told you that your website could use this blazingly fast new technology too? And that the cost would be even lower than a regular WordPress website?</p>
