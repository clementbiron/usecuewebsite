I"D<p>La Manzanilla brings the most exclusive and tasty olive oil in the world to the (lucky) people of Amsterdam. The webshop sends the order to the shop owner, who in its turn sends a payment link to the customer. This way there is no need for a payment integration, which reduces overhead for this small business owner.</p>
