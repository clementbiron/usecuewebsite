I am Joost van der Schee and I have founded Usecue BV (LLC) in 2007. I create elegant hand-coded websites and web applications for my clients. My focus lies on efficiency and quality in the design and development process. Usecue specializes in building custom solutions and mainly works for advertising agencies and graphical designers.

I have studied Industrial Design Engeneering at the Technical University in Delft. This has provided me with an analytical view of the design process and human-computer interaction.

I am a big fan of CloudCannon, an online CMS system for Jekyll. CloudCannon recently mentioned me on their 'featured developers page'. I love to do things thoroughly. Going slow is not really my style. Apart from CloudCannon websites I also develop WordPress, Issuu, MailChimp and Shopify solutions. Finally, I have also build my own platform for producing online magazines, called 'without coding'.

Interested? Do you want quality for a decent price? Please&nbsp;[contact](/contact)&nbsp;me! I would love to get to know you and hear about your project.
