In my blog posts I write about technical innovations, news items and opinions in the web development space. This can be a 'best-practise' or a personal discovery worth sharing. Looking back at the past few years, I can say most posts are related to website speed, performance, usability or Jekyll (the static site generator). I have also written some posts in [Dutch](](https://www.usecue.nl/blog/).
