title: Flash scaling in HTML
---


Back in the days your website would be a rectangle, filled with one big interactive Flash canvas. The nice thing about it was that it would always fit your screen. Nowadays I sometimes get the request to build something like that again. Flash obviously is a no-go, so I build a demo to show how to do that in HTML and CSS. Check it out!
