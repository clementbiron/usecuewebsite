title: Google will shame slow sites
---

At Chrome Dev Summit Google announced that it "is looking at ways to reward developers for going the extra mile when it comes to website performance". 

They shared some early explorations which surface speed signals in the Chrome’s UI, like a preloading screen warning you for the slow experience or a colored loading bar. Google said it will identify sites that typically load fast or slow for users with clear badging. This may take a number of forms and they plan to experiment with different options, to determine which provides the most value to their users, according to [the Crome blog](https://blog.chromium.org/2019/11/moving-towards-faster-web.html).

## The SSL approach

It sounds nice, but do not be fooled by the words 'reward' and 'badging'. When I heard this I immediately recalled the way Google approached SSL. First they awarded all secure websites with a green badge and later they made the green badge gray and actively shamed non-SSL websites by displaying 'Not secure' in front of their URL. Additionally, they promoted SSL websites in their search results and demoted non-SSL websites. I expect them to go for an identical approach here as their SSL approach was very effective.

## Speed is very important

In a blogpost the Chromium team says that "speed has been one of Chrome’s core principles since the beginning", and that they "are constantly working to give users an experience that is [instant](/blog/websites-that-load-instantly/) as they browse the web". Google was VERY succesful when it introduced its new faster browser in 2008. It changed the whole browser market by focussing on 'speed'. Everybody wanted a faster internet. Without any hesitation we all switched to Chrome and Google seems to remember that very well. These are not just hollow phrases from Google, as they recently added a non-standard performance solutions to Chrome ([lazy loading](https://web.dev/native-lazy-loading/)). I can only see that as a trick to keep their speed advantage over other browsers. Nevertheless it is a confirmation that speed is very important to Google.

## Is Google fixing the internet?

I would say that Google is (at least partly) responsible for the decay in website speed, as Google has made advertisement networks and third-party requests the norm. They created services like Google fonts, Google Analytics, Google Tag Manager and Google Ads. Those third party requests are not only the most important reason the internet is so terribly slow, but also the reason why your privacy is so severely violated. Let us face the truth: Not Ralph, but Google broke the internet. 

However, with SSL and their focus on website performance, Google seems to be on the right track. Promoting a safer and faster internet is a good thing. A faster internet has no room for slow, privacy-invading, third-party scripts, it is greener and cheaper and it makes the internet more accessible. The big question remains: Why? What is their motive? Is Google really trying to fix the internet and make this world a better place? Or is this a way of promoting their super fast, Google owned, alternative internet, called Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP)? I truly hope the latter is not true and I am just being cynical.

## Invest in speed

Either way, we have no choice but to invest in speed. Google owns most searches and therefore makes the rules. If we want our websites to perform well in Google, we will have to invest in website performance and build [faster websites](/blog/websites-that-load-instantly/). Fortunately, I know a thing or two about that. If you do not: this is your time to start catching up.
