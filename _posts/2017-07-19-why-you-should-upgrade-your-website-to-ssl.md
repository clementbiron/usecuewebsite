title: Why you should upgrade your website to SSL
---


SSL or Secure Socket Layer is better known as the S in HTTPS. It stands for an encrypted connection between the website and the visitor. So why should you upgrade? Here are the three main reasons:

**1. Security and privacy**
<br>The most important reason is that is safer for you and for your visitors to use an SSL website.

**2. Higher Google ranking**
<br>Google will rank websites with SSL higher then website without SSL. This is Googles way of promoting a safer internet.

**3. Authenticity**
<br>Give clients and extra reason to trust your company by having that green icon and the word 'Secure' before your domain name.
