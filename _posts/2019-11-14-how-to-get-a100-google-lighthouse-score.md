title: How to get a 100% Google Lighthouse score
---

You might have heard that soon [Google will shame slow websites](/blog/google-will-shame-slow-websites). A good reason to take a good look at your [Google Lighthouse score](/blog/google-lighthouse-score). 

In this blogpost I will share with you the secret on how to get a 100% Google Lighthouse score. To determine what the end-result should be, let's look at some websites (I built) that score the so much desired 100% on all four categories:

## De Baby Wegwijzer

- Total size: 120Kb
- Number of requests: 9
- TTFB: 22ms
- DOMContentLoaded: 274ms
- Loading time: 596ms

## Studio InHout

- Total size: 115Kb
- Number of requests: 9
- TTFB: 16ms
- DOMContentLoaded: 307ms
- Loading time: 564ms

## Usecue BV

- Total size: 44Kb
- Number of requests: 7
- TTFB: 15ms
- DOMContentLoaded: 231ms
- Loading time: 363ms

We need a very low page weight, a very low number of requests and a low TTFB.
