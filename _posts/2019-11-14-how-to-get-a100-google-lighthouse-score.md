---

You might have heard that soon [Google will shame slow websites](/blog/google-will-shame-slow-websites). A good reason to take a good look at your [Google Lighthouse score](/blog/google-lighthouse-score). 

When you do, I bet you wonder how get to a perfect 100%. Well.. I have built many websites that score perfectly, or nearly perfect on these Googles charts. So, I obviously got the answer. And if I can built 100% scoring websites on a daily basis, you already guessed that it is a lot easier than you think.

## Some sample websites

Lets start by looking at some websites that score the so much desired 100% on all four categories, to determine what the end-results can look like.

## The essential steps



There are basically two approaches possible. 

## Approach 1. The painfull approach

Delete Agency improved their website until it reached a 100% score. A great achievement, but also [an awful lot of work](https://www.deleteagency.com/blog/how-to-get-a-100-percents-lighthouse-performance-score).

## Approach 2. The simple approach


### The right stack

Fortunately, there is a much simpler method. Just make your website 5 times smaller. How to do that?
