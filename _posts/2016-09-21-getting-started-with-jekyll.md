title: Getting started with Jekyll
---


I have written a three step&nbsp;[Getting Started manual for Jekyll](http://jekyllcodex.org/getting-started/). The manual can be followed by anyone (no command line). Everything you need can be done in a browser.

*What is Jekyll?*&nbsp;Jekyll is the most popular static site generator available. A lot of big companies, like Google and Netflix use Jekyll for their website development. The Obama campaign (fundraising) website has also been [built](http://kylerush.net/blog/meet-the-obama-campaigns-250-million-fundraising-platform/) using Jekyll.

*Why should I use Jekyll/a static site generator?*&nbsp;Static sites are quick to develop and extremely simple to adjust. Hosting is also much cheaper. They can easily be optimized for SEO and speed. As a bonus, static websites are extremely stable and they can handle a huge amount of visitors.

So do you want a next-generation website? Get to know Jekyll and follow my&nbsp;[Geting started](http://jekyllcodex.org/getting-started/)&nbsp;guide! Your first Jekyll site is only minutes away!
