title: Getting started with Jekyll
---


I have written a three step&nbsp;[Getting Started manual for Jekyll](http://jekyllcodex.org/getting-started/). The manual can be followed by ANYONE and does not require you to use the command line. Everything can be done in a browser.

**What is Jekyll?**
<br>Jekyll is the most popular static site generator available.

**Why should I use a static site generator?**
<br>Static sites are quick to develop and extremely simple to adjust. Hosting is much cheaper. They can easily be optimized for SEO and speed. As a bonus, static websites are extremely stable and they can handle a huge amount of visitors.

So what are you waiting for? [Get started](http://jekyllcodex.org/getting-started/) and build your first Jekyll website today!
