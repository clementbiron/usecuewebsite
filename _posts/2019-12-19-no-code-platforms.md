title: No-code platforms
---

No-code platforms promise the content creator that he/she does not need a designer or developer. We have seen very big players try this for many many years with mixed results. I am talking about Adobe with Muse, Wix, Webflow, Squarespace and WordPress with all kinds of page builders and recently with Gutenberg.

## No-code platforms for content creators

The output of these no-code platforms is often horrible from a developer and art director point of view. I have to admit that creating a theme with a completely fixed design works when you sell it in large numbers, but for unique designs it is terribly expensive. WordPress themes like Avada hit the sweet spot between freedom and fixed style, but they perform really bad. Visual editors, like Gutenberg, balance this freedom quite well. However, an efficient and high quality 'no-code' solution for content creators does not exist (yet). For now a fixed theme in combination with a visual editor is the closest you can get to creating something beautiful, but this solution still has draw-backs.

Let's look at Gutenberg, for example. It loads a 40kb blocking CSS in your WordPress website, while it can only create a handful of different blocks. That is twice the size of my complete homepage while it is blocking and none of your own stuff has loaded yet. Avada is even worse and loads a 700kb(!) blocking CSS file. Wix is even worse... and this is all just from a technical point of view. Because we all know what happens when we let content creators freely influence design. Noting good...

Still, we keep dreaming that there is some magic solution that gives content creators design and development powers, but why? Creating low quality stuff without designers and developers is an option. OK, I get it. It is the reason Google AMP exists. Let's move on...

## No-code platforms for designers

Note that I have my fair share of experience with no-code platforms. I have built and own [Without Coding](https://withoutcoding.com/). A platform where designers can build digital productions (like magazines and landing pages). The output is static HTML, so it is basically an static site generator (SSG). 

No-code platforms work for designers that do not know how to (or want to) hand-off a final design. However, I have not met a lot of professional designers that actually want to build their own websites on a no-code platform. Most designer only want to do what they are really good at: design. They want to out-source the coding part. I get that and it is smart from a business point of view. As a designer it is very valuable to know a good developer. So my advice to developers is: invest in relations with designers. It will pay off. 

## No-code platforms for developers

Because most designers rather have a developer build their website then doing it themselves on a no-code platform, no-code platforms are more of a tool for (inexperienced) developers. I think Webflow could be just that. However, I think it might be smarter for developers to learn HTML and CSS than to learn how to work with Webflow. In the end code will always beat no-code. To illustrate this, I have built a website in the browser during my talk at [JekyllConf2019](https://jekyllconf.com/). It included version control (git), a bootswatch theme, a form builder and a CMS. I did the whole thing live in under 20 minutes. Can those development times be beaten with browser-based no-code tools (like Webflow)? I think not.

## Conclusion

There is not really a good market fit for no-code platforms. Designers want to focus on designing. Developers are slower and produce worse results with no-code platforms. The only fit would be: content creators on do-it-yourself projects. However, we should not take those DIY projects too seriously. A gardner is not very concerned about people gardening 'on their own', so neither should we. We need to see these DIY projects in the right perspective. This right perpective defines a mature(d) and professional field of work.
