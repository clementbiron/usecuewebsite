title: From Wordpress to CloudCannon
---


I am a freelance web designer and I create elegant, hand-crafted websites for my clients.&nbsp;

I was using Wordpress to build client sites. Wordpress could do everything I needed, but my main concerns with using Wordpress were the lack of security (due to third party plugins), the high maintenance cost and the lack of version control. I wanted a platform my clients loved and that would reduce the risk and work for me.

**How CloudCannon helped**
<br>I found CloudCannon and thought “Oh my goodness, this is the solution I’ve been dreaming about”. I now spends less time coding, gets sites live faster and no longer have to worry about security or back-ups.

My workflow is more streamlined too. I develop sites on my local computer and sync to CloudCannon using GitHub. If a client site needs tweaking urgently, I can login to CloudCannon on any computer, anywhere in the world and quickly make updates using the online code editor.

My clients gave CloudCannon the thumbs up. They found updating in CloudCannon easier and could update sections of the site they couldn’t before.&nbsp;

**Unique additions**
<br>I provide some unique additions to my CloudCannon sites to make the client experience even smoother. First of all I use an image resizing service, to make sure clients do not have to worry about file sizes and cropping of images. Secondly, I have added a low traffic CDN for these resized images to improve performance and SEO. Finally, I have created a form builder to be able to easily create static forms that can be submitted through FormSubmit.

**The end result**
<br>With the help of the amazing CloudCannon team I am able to offer a professional managed hosting solution. This solution includes an online CMS, an online code editor, full version control, external hosting (if required), no vendor lock in (because Jekyll is open source) and a very happy developer.
