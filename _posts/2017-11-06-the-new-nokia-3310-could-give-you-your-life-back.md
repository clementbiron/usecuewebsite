title: The new Nokia 3310 could give you your life back

Let's face it: Modern smartphones make you dumb, anti-social and they steel your time. You know it is true, no need for figures. If you disagree it is only because you are addicted.

But you need your smartphone, you say. But what is it that you actually need? You want to take an occasional picture, look up something on the internet, find a location or route, look up something in your email and communicate with your friends. That is it. Well the Nokia 3310 comes really close, providing a camera, a basic internet browser, Google Maps, Gmail, Twitter and Facebook.

**Lack of Whatsapp**<br>Whatsapp can not be accessed on the Nokia 3310. If you can convince your friends to use Facebook Groups to communicate, instead of Whatsapp, you are done. However, I am afraid most people can not. The reason that there is no solution for Whatsapp is because Whatsapp does not cooperate. Simple solutions, like converting Whatsapp messages to email, using an automation service, like IFTT, could solve this problem. But Whatsapp has chosen not to provide an API, which makes this route impossible. If your friends all use Telegram, IFTT works. True friends use Telegram ;-), but yours might not.

**Bots to the rescue?**<br>So the new Nokia 3310 is very good at calling and texting and does a medium job at the rest. However, many plans can send and receive unlimited SMS for free. The only thing you need to use this phone comfortably is a bot (or automation process). You could use text messaging to ask this bot for directions, translations, definitions or basic website information. You could also let this bot convert social media messages to SMS. Preferably the bot would send these messages scheduled, just once or twice a day.

**Another simple solution**<br>Because you do not want to be bothered every moment of the day by Whatsapp, you can choose to view Whatsapp solely at home on your PC. A better experience anyway, because of the keyboard, chair, coffee and the larger screen. This requires a cheap Android device to stay connected with both Whatsapp and your local network. A very nice solution would be&nbsp;[/uploads/istreamer-x96-64-bit-amlogic-s905x-20-ghz-quadcore-1.jpg](/uploads/istreamer-x96-64-bit-amlogic-s905x-20-ghz-quadcore-1.jpg) for 45 euro. It has no battery and runs Android. It can be your always on device that exists for the sole purpose of keeping your computer connected to Whatsapp.

So... buy the retro Nokia 3310 for just under 50 euro. It will have a standby time of a month. And most importantly: it will give you your life backâ€¦
