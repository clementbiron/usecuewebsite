title: The speed of Chrome
---

In 2008 Google promised us websites that would load as quick as shooting a potato through a slicer with explosives. In other words, in one or two tenths of a second. 

Their campaign revolved around the introduction of v8, a much faster JavaScript engine. This turned out to be a game changer and made Chrome significantly faster than any other browser at the time. The campaign was a big hit and Chrome (eventually) became the most used browser world wide.

In this specific video they used the website allrecipes.com. I was curious to see how fast it loads today. We could ask Lighthouse, but Lighthouse simulaties a slow 3G connection. So I asked Pingdom. Pingdom told me that the current website of allrecipes.com loads in 3.6 seconds. So this website has either became MUCH slower in the past 11 years OR they were looking at a preloaded website.

From the video description we can see that they used a preloaded website (a local version of the site). However, with Googles current focus on speed, I was wondering: Can a website actually load in 0.2 seconds over the web? Could a website match the potato gun speed? The answer is a definitive YES. This website loads in 0.16 seconds. Don't believe me? Ask Pingdom. What it requires? Heavily compressed images little JavaScript and no jQuery (and a server not to far away).

Do you want a website that beats the potato gun? A website that is as quick as Chrome? No problem. Just give me a call.
