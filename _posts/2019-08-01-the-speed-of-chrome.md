title: The speed of Chrome
---

In 2010 Google promised us websites that would load as quick as shooting a potato through a slicer with explosives. In other words, in one or two tenths of a second. The speed of Chrome turned out to be a game changer. Chrome became the most used browser world wide. 

In their video they used the website allrecipes.com. I was curious to see how fast it loads today, so I asked the Pingdom. The current website loads in 3.6 seconds. So, allrecipes.com has either became MUCH slower in the past 9 years OR they were talking about a preloaded website in 2010. 

Can a website actually load in 0.2 seconds? The answer is a definitive YES. This website loads in 0.16 seconds. Don't believe me? Ask Pingdom. That is 1.6 seconds in a (240FPS) slow motion video on your iPhoneX.
