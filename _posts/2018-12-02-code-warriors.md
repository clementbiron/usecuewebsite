A true warrior masters his sword and his mind. A 'code warrior' masters his framework and his system. Mastering your framework is not the most difficult part. Mastering the system that makes your framework function, however, can take a lifetime. 

Most developers aspire to master only their framework/sword and not also their system/mind. They agree to a solution where a framework executes 'unknown code'. It seems that the more unknown code is being executed, the more popular a solution will be. Plugins are a great way of hiding code. The most popular blogging platform has millions of plugins. Newfangled (popular) strategies like 'containers' and 'serverless' are even better at hiding code. It is clearly the direction we are heading right now. 

Why do people like 'unknown code' so much? The key word is 'efficiency'. People do not like to reinvent the wheel. They want shortcuts and 'unknown code' promises shortcuts and efficiency. A true code warrior knows that there are no shortcuts. Everybody should design and build there own wheel. Maybe, when you fully understand how it all works, you should be allowed to choose somebody elses solution. Else, why do we make children learn stuff by doing and failing and not by carefully instructing them how to do it right? Because we know that trying and failing leads to true understanding of the matter, leads to 'mastering' it. We know this is true, yet in an industry where learning is very important, we love to forget this. And do you know what the result is? An industry full of poor code, poor performance and poor security. 

Allowing too much unknown code is shameful, is costing us lots of money and jeopardizes our privacy and thus our freedom. It is time for 'code warriors' to fight unknown code. True warriors with angular weaponry, who can see sharp, react fast and hit like a meteor. 

Code warriors: Unite!
