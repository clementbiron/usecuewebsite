title: The Nokia 3310 could give you your life back
---


Let's face it: Modern smartphones make you dumb, anti-social and they steel your time. You know it is true, no need for figures. If you disagree it is only because you are addicted.

But you need your smartphone, you say. But what is it that you actually need? You want to take an occasional picture, look up something on the internet, find a location or route, lookup something in your email and communicate on&nbsp; social channels with your friends. That is it. Well the Nokia 3310 comes really close, providing a camera, a basic internet browser, Google Maps, Gmail, Twitter and Facebook.

**Lack of Whatsapp**<br>Whatsapp can not be accessed on the Nokia 3310. If you can convince your friends to use Facebook Groups to communicate, instead of Whatsapp, you are done. However, I am afraid most people can not. The reason that there is no solution for Whatsapp is because Whatsapp does not cooperate. Simple solutions, like converting Whatsapp messages to email, using an automation service, like IFTT, could solve this problem. But Whatsapp has chosen not to provide an API, which makes this route impossible. If your friends all use Telegram, IFTT works. True friends use Telegram ;-), but yours might not.

**The solution**<br>So the new Nokia 3310 is very good at calling and texting. Many plans can send and receive unlimited SMS for free. The only thing you need is a bot (or automation process) that you can add to your social channels. This bot could convert messages to SMS. Preferably the bot would sent these messages scheduled, just once or twice a day. This would give you all basic functions of a smartphone, for under 50 euro, with a standby time of a month. And most importantly: it will give you your life backâ€¦
