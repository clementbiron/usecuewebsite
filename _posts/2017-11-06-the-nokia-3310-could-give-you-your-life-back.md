title: The Nokia 3310 could give you your life back
---


Let's face it: Modern smartphones make you dumb, anti-social and they steel your time. You know it is true, no need for figures. If you disagree it is only because you are addicted.

You need your smartphone, you say. But what DO you actually need? A camera maybe, some basic website lookups, a maps application, access to your email and access to the social channels your friends are on. Well the Nokia 3310 comes really close, providing a camera, a basic internet browser, Google Maps, Gmail, Twitter and Facebook.

**Lack of Whatsapp**<br>Whatsapp can not be accessed on the Nokia 3310. If you can convince your friends to use Facebook Groups to communicate, instead of Whatsapp, you are done. However, I am afraid most people can not. The reason that there is no solution for Whatsapp is because Whatsapp does not cooperate. Simple solutions, like converting Whatsapp messages to email, using an automation service, like IFTT, could solve this problem. But Whatsapp has chosen not to provide an API, which makes this route impossible. If your friends all use Telegram, IFTT can send all Whatsapp messages automatically to your email. True friends use Telegram ;-), but yours might not.

**The solution**<br>So we have a phone that can read and send basic messages. Many plans can send and receive unlimited/free SMS. If you would be able to add a bot or an automation process to your social channels, you could program them to send you SMS updates on all social events. Preferably they would be send just once or twice a day, to give you some peace in between. This would give you all basic functions of a smartphone, for under 50 euro, with a standby time of a month. And it will give you your life back...
