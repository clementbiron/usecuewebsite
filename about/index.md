I create and host elegant, hand-coded websites and web applications for my clients. [Interested?](/about/)

I am Joost van der Schee and I have founded Usecue BV (LLC) in 2007. I create and host elegant hand-coded websites and web applications for my clients. My focus lies on efficiency and quality in the design and development process. My websites have a good [Google score](/google-lighthouse-score/), a low [Speed index](/speed-index) and a [page weight](/page-weight/) that is as low as possible. With a little extra effort and money, I can make websites even [load instantly](/blog/websites-that-load-instantly/).

I have studied Industrial Design Engeneering at the Technical University in Delft. This has provided me with an analytical view of the design process and human-computer interaction.

I am a Linux fan, but I am also a big fan of [CloudCannon](https://cloudcannon.com/), an online CMS system for Jekyll. CloudCannon mentioned me on their '[experts page](https://cloudcannon.com/experts/)'. I launched [jekyllcodex.org](http://jekyllcodex.org) and I reached over half a million people by answering Jekyll-related questions on Stack Overflow. 

Apart from Jekyll/CloudCannon websites I also develop WordPress, Issuu, MailChimp, Shopify and custom web solutions. 

I am the author of the [open source invoicing software](https://www.invoicelion.org/), called 'Invoice Lion' and a [platform for producing online magazines](https://withoutcoding.com), called 'Without Coding'.

Interested? Please [contact](/contact) me! I would love to get to know you and hear about your project.
