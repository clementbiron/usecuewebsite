My name is Joost van der Schee. I consider myself to be a programmer. I have founded Usecue BV (LLC) in 2007. I have studied Industrial Design Engeneering at the Technical University in Delft. 

My focus lies on efficiency and quality in the design and development process. All websites I built are well-coded and have good SEO. This is reflected by their excellent [Google score](/blog/google-lighthouse-score/), an objective quality measurement of a website. Quality is very important to me. I strongly believe that each job worth doing is worth doing well.

I am a big fan of Jekyll (a static site generator). To help fellow Jekyll-enthusiasts, I have launched [jekyllcodex.org](http://jekyllcodex.org) and I answer Jekyll-related questions on [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/users/2397550/joosts). [CloudCannon](https://cloudcannon.com/) (an online CMS for Jekyll) mentioned me as a Jekyll expert on their '[experts page](https://cloudcannon.com/experts/)'.

Apart from Jekyll/CloudCannon websites I also develop WordPress, Issuu, MailChimp, Shopify and custom web solutions. My latest projects include [open source invoicing software](https://www.invoicelion.org/), called 'Invoice Lion', a progressive web app (PWA) for my company and a [platform for producing online magazines](https://withoutcoding.com), called 'Without Coding'.
