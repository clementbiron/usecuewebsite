title: Google (Lighthouse) score
---

What is a 'Google score' exactly, you ask? The short answer is: it is a measurement from Google, that indicates the quality of your website.

Are you ready for the long answer? Google renders your website on a server in Chrome. The code and performance of your website is analyzed by Google. Google audits are seperated into four categories: performance, accessibility, best practices and SEO. Each category scores between 0 and 100.

## Performance

Lighthouse returns a Performance score between 0 and 100. 0 is the lowest possible score. 100 is the best possible score which represents the 98th percentile, a top-performing site. A score of 50 represents the 75th percentile.

## Accessibility

The Accessibility score is a weighted average of all the accessibility audits. See Scoring Details for a full list of how each audit is weighted. The heavier-weighted audits have a bigger impact on your score. 

## Best practices

Lighthouse returns a Best Practices score between 0 and 100. 0 is the worst possible score, and 100 is the best. The Best Practices audits are equally weighted.

## SEO

Lighthouse returns a SEO score between 0 and 100. 0 is the worst possible score, and 100 is the best. A website with a high SEO score will end up higher in the search results.
